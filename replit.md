## Data Flow

Since this is a static website, there is no dynamic data flow. The architecture follows a simple client-side rendering pattern:

1. **Client Request**: Browser requests HTML page
2. **Static Asset Loading**: HTML, CSS, and external resources (fonts, icons) load
3. **Rendering**: Browser renders the complete page
4. **User Interaction**: Limited to navigation and potential form submissions

## External Dependencies

### CDN Resources
- **Font Awesome 6.0.0**: Icon library for UI elements
- **Google Fonts**: Roboto font family with multiple weights (300, 400, 500, 700)

### Design System
- **Color Scheme**: Professional color palette with primary focus on accessibility
- **Typography**: Roboto font stack with fallback to sans-serif
- **Iconography**: Font Awesome icons for contact information and navigation

## Deployment Strategy

### Current Architecture
- **Static Hosting**: Suitable for any static web hosting service
- **No Server Requirements**: Pure client-side application
- **Asset Optimization**: Minimal assets for fast loading

### Recommended Hosting Options
- GitHub Pages
- Netlify
- Vercel
- Traditional web hosting with static file support

### Performance Considerations
- External CDN usage for fonts and icons
- Minimal CSS and HTML for fast loading
- SVG logo for scalable graphics
